Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    inline element doesn’t start on a new line and only occupy just the width it requires. You can’t set the width or height.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse with other margins. The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    margin
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Inline: <span> , <strong>
    Inline-block: <img>
    Display block: <p> <article> <footer>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
The CSS box model is the set of rules that decides how a CSS element’s sizes are configured as you add padding, borders, and margins around the content. The problem is that you have so many things, like margin, borders,etc dumped on each other. Tightly spaced elements have a good chance of overlapping each other.  You can use box-sizing: border-box to fix the problem.
Stretch Extras
A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.
The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.merging takes the contents of a source branch and integrates them with a target branch.Rebase compresses all the changes into a single “patch.” Then it integrates the patch onto the target branch.
git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo.Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified. git clean is a convenience method for deleting untracked files in a repo's working directory.
